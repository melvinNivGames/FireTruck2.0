# FireTruck2.0
My case study in Software Engineering.

The game's mechanics is a bit similar to the popular android game the Piano Tiles.
The player needs to tap the fire as it go down in the screen. The more the fire extinguishes, the game speed will increase. 
The game has a features of saving high scores, it can be paused, and it can set the sound On and Off.
